# Delta-Based Options Market Making Strategy

## üéØ Project Overview
This project implements a framework for options market making and backtesting using real and historical data. The system fetches SPY options data from Yahoo Finance or loads historical options data from CSV files, calculates theoretical prices and Greeks, and simulates market making strategies with inventory and risk management.

## üîç Core Concepts
**Market Making**: Acting as a liquidity provider by continuously quoting bid/ask prices for options contracts, aiming to profit from the bid-ask spread while managing inventory risk.

**Delta Hedging**: Maintaining a delta-neutral portfolio by dynamically adjusting positions in the underlying asset to offset directional risk from options exposure.

## üìä Strategy Components
- **Data Import**: Fetches live SPY options data or loads historical data from CSV for backtesting.
- **Options Pricing Engine**: Black-Scholes pricing and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) calculations. Calculate IV from market prices. Use market IV to fit a smooth model
- **Build vol surface**: Use IV model to compute theoretical prices
- **Market Making Logic**: Sets bid/ask quotes around theoretical fair value, simulates fills, and manages inventory.
- **Risk Management**: Delta hedging, position limits, and PnL tracking.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Evaluates strategy performance on historical data.

## üßÆ Mathematical Framework
- Black-Scholes Model for European option pricing
- Greeks calculations (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)

## SABR Volatility Surface Fitting Workflow

This section describes the steps for fitting a volatility surface using the SABR model in the `src/vol_surface.py` module.

### 1. Import Required Libraries
- Use `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy.optimize`, and `matplotlib` for calculations and visualization.

### 2. Implement the SABR Implied Volatility Formula
- Write a function to compute SABR implied volatility given parameters (alpha, beta, rho, nu), strike, forward, and expiry.

### 3. Define the SABR Calibration Objective
- Create a function that fits SABR parameters to market IVs for a given expiry by minimizing the error between model and market IVs.

### 4. Fit SABR Parameters for Each Expiry
- For each unique expiry (or expiry/tenor group), fit SABR parameters to the observed IVs across strikes.

### 5. Store and Interpolate the Fitted Surface
- Store the fitted SABR parameters for each expiry.
- Optionally, interpolate parameters across expiries for a smooth surface.

### 6. Create a Class or Functions for Surface Evaluation
- Implement a class or functions that return the SABR IV for a given strike and expiry using the fitted parameters.

### 7. Visualization and Diagnostics
- Plot the fitted SABR surface versus market IVs to check fit quality.

### 8. (Optional) Save/Load Fitted Surface
- Save the fitted parameters to disk for reuse in future analysis.

**Summary:**
- Implement SABR formula and calibration
- Fit parameters for each expiry
- Evaluate and visualize the surface
- Save/load fitted results as needed
